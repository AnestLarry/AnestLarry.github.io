        <h1>0x0 Background</h1>
<p>I've been using Hexo for static blogging for almost four years. Time flies. After I passively upgraded my nodejs, my Hexo could no longer work properly.</p>
<p>I thought about installing a new Hexo, but I couldn't remember what plugins were installed at the time. That means I can't recover my blog again (Because I know nothing about Hexo or nodejs project. Use Hexo just because it's popular). Now, the problem is here that I almost could do nothing unless I learning nodejs and Hexo again.</p>
<p>I am considering a blogging program skills stack that must be in mine. Or it is easy to transfer and recover.</p>
<p>Another consideration is static blog program performance. From what I remember, Hexo compile all static post almost from a few seconds to a dozen seconds.</p>
<p>So, I am trying to write a static blog program to make generated page as simple as write markdown. Then, high performance by C#. In my first QuickBlog version (just markdown to html and index by time order), it cost 200ms avg. Surprise me. Now I really want to write this program.</p>
<h1>0x1 Features</h1>
<p>In my first version, I found some features leaking make the blog doesn't like a blog. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Index Page</li>
<li>[x] Year/Month archive</li>
<li>[x] static file
<ul>
<li>highlight code included</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] categories Finished on: Apr 20, 2025.</li>
<li>[x] tags Finished on: Jun 27, 2025.</li>
<li>[ ] loading configure</li>
<li>[ ] plugins</li>
<li>[ ] embedded program language</li>
</ul>

<p>I will Edit this page several times...</p>
